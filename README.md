# level-rocksdb

**This package has been discontinued. Please see [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/Level/community#faq).**

## Introduction

This is a convenience package that:

- exports a function that returns a [`levelup instance`](https://github.com/Level/levelup#ctor) when invoked
- bundles the current release of [`levelup`][levelup] and [`rocksdb`][rocksdb]
- leverages encodings using [`encoding-down`][encoding-down]

Use this package to avoid having to explicitly install `rocksdb` when you want to use RocksDB with `levelup`. See also [`level`][level] which does the same for LevelDB.

## Usage

**If you are upgrading:** please see [`UPGRADING.md`](UPGRADING.md).

```js
const level = require('level-rocksdb')

// 1) Create our database, supply location and options.
//    This will create or open the underlying RocksDB store.
const db = level('./mydb')

// 2) Put a key & value
db.put('name', 'Level', function (err) {
  if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err) // some kind of I/O error

  // 3) Fetch by key
  db.get('name', function (err, value) {
    if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err) // likely the key was not found

    // Ta da!
    console.log('name=' + value)
  })
})
```

With `async/await`:

```js
await db.put('name', 'Level')
const value = await db.get('name')
```

<a name="ctor"></a>
### `const db = level(location[, options[, callback]])`
The main entry point for creating a new `levelup` instance.

- `location` path to the underlying `LevelDB`.
- `options` is passed on to the underlying store.
- `options.keyEncoding` and `options.valueEncoding` are passed to [`encoding-down`][encoding-down], default encoding is `'utf8'`

Calling `level('./db')` will also open the underlying store. This is an asynchronous operation which will trigger your callback if you provide one. The callback should take the form `function (err, db) {}` where `db` is the `levelup` instance. If you don't provide a callback, any read & write operations are simply queued internally until the store is fully opened.

This leads to two alternative ways of managing a `levelup` instance:

```js
level(location, options, function (err, db) {
  if (err) throw err

  db.get('foo', function (err, value) {
    if (err) return console.log('foo does not exist')
    console.log('got foo =', value)
  })
})
```

Versus the equivalent:

```js
// Will throw if an error occurs
const db = level(location, options)

db.get('foo', function (err, value) {
  if (err) return console.log('foo does not exist')
  console.log('got foo =', value)
})
```

The constructor function has a `.errors` property which provides access to the different error types from [`level-errors`](https://github.com/Level/errors#api). See example below on how to use it:

```js
level('./db', { createIfMissing: false }, function (err, db) {
  if (err instanceof level.errors.OpenError) {
    console.log('failed to open database')
  }
})
```

<a name="open"></a>
### `db.open([callback])`
Opens the underlying store. In general you should never need to call this method directly as it's automatically called by <a href="#ctor"><code>levelup()</code></a>.

However, it is possible to *reopen* the store after it has been closed with <a href="#close"><code>close()</code></a>, although this is not generally advised.

If no callback is passed, a promise is returned.

<a name="close"></a>
### `db.close([callback])`
<code>close()</code> closes the underlying store. The callback will receive any error encountered during closing as the first argument.

You should always clean up your `levelup` instance by calling `close()` when you no longer need it to free up resources. A store cannot be opened by multiple instances of `levelup` simultaneously.

If no callback is passed, a promise is returned.

<a name="put"></a>
### `db.put(key, value[, options][, callback])`
<code>put()</code> is the primary method for inserting data into the store. Both `key` and `value` can be of any type as far as `levelup` is concerned.

`options` is passed on to the underlying store.

If no callback is passed, a promise is returned.

<a name="get"></a>
### `db.get(key[, options][, callback])`
<code>get()</code> is the primary method for fetching data from the store. The `key` can be of any type. If it doesn't exist in the store then the callback or promise will receive an error. A not-found err object will be of type `'NotFoundError'` so you can `err.type == 'NotFoundError'` or you can perform a truthy test on the property `err.notFound`.

```js
db.get('foo', function (err, value) {
  if (err) {
    if (err.notFound) {
      // handle a 'NotFoundError' here
      return
    }
    // I/O or other error, pass it up the callback chain
    return callback(err)
  }

  // .. handle `value` here
})
```

`options` is passed on to the underlying store.

If no callback is passed, a promise is returned.

<a name="del"></a>
### `db.del(key[, options][, callback])`
<code>del()</code> is the primary method for removing data from the store.
```js
db.del('foo', function (err) {
  if (err)
    // handle I/O or other error
});
```

`options` is passed on to the underlying store.

If no callback is passed, a promise is returned.

<a name="batch"></a>
### `db.batch(array[, options][, callback])` *(array form)*
<code>batch()</code> can be used for very fast bulk-write operations (both *put* and *delete*). The `array` argument should contain a list of operations to be executed sequentially, although as a whole they are performed as an atomic operation inside the underlying store.

Each operation is contained in an object having the following properties: `type`, `key`, `value`, where the *type* is either `'put'` or `'del'`. In the case of `'del'` the `value` property is ignored. Any entries with a `key` of `null` or `undefined` will cause an error to be returned on the `callback` and any `type: 'put'` entry with a `value` of `null` or `undefined` will return an error.

If `key` and `value` are defined but `type` is not, it will default to `'put'`.

```js
const ops = [
  { type: 'del', key: 'father' },
  { type: 'put', key: 'name', value: 'Yuri Irsenovich Kim' },
  { type: 'put', key: 'dob', value: '16 February 1941' },
  { type: 'put', key: 'spouse', value: 'Kim Young-sook' },
  { type: 'put', key: 'occupation', value: 'Clown' }
]

db.batch(ops, function (err) {
  if (err) return console.log('Ooops!', err)
  console.log('Great success dear leader!')
})
```

`options` is passed on to the underlying store.

If no callback is passed, a promise is returned.

<a name="batch_chained"></a>
### `db.batch()` *(chained form)*
<code>batch()</code>, when called with no arguments will return a `Batch` object which can be used to build, and eventually commit, an atomic batch operation. Depending on how it's used, it is possible to obtain greater performance when using the chained form of `batch()` over the array form.

```js
db.batch()
  .del('father')
  .put('name', 'Yuri Irsenovich Kim')
  .put('dob', '16 February 1941')
  .put('spouse', 'Kim Young-sook')
  .put('occupation', 'Clown')
  .write(function () { console.log('Done!') })
```

<b><code>batch.put(key, value)</code></b>

Queue a *put* operation on the current batch, not committed until a `write()` is called on the batch.

This method may `throw` a `WriteError` if there is a problem with your put (such as the `value` being `null` or `undefined`).

<b><code>batch.del(key)</code></b>

Queue a *del* operation on the current batch, not committed until a `write()` is called on the batch.

This method may `throw` a `WriteError` if there is a problem with your delete.

<b><code>batch.clear()</code></b>

Clear all queued operations on the current batch, any previous operations will be discarded.

<b><code>batch.length</code></b>

The number of queued operations on the current batch.

<b><code>batch.write([callback])</code></b>

Commit the queued operations for this batch. All operations not *cleared* will be written to the underlying store atomically, that is, they will either all succeed or fail with no partial commits.

If no callback is passed, a promise is returned.

<a name="isOpen"></a>
### `db.isOpen()`

A `levelup` instance can be in one of the following states:

  * *"new"*     - newly created, not opened or closed
  * *"opening"* - waiting for the underlying store to be opened
  * *"open"*    - successfully opened the store, available for use
  * *"closing"* - waiting for the store to be closed
  * *"closed"*  - store has been successfully closed, should not be used

`isOpen()` will return `true` only when the state is "open".

<a name="isClosed"></a>
### `db.isClosed()`

*See <a href="#put"><code>isOpen()</code></a>*

`isClosed()` will return `true` only when the state is "closing" *or* "closed", it can be useful for determining if read and write operations are permissible.

<a name="createReadStream"></a>
### `db.createReadStream([options])`

Returns a [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) of key-value pairs. A pair is an object with `key` and `value` properties. By default it will stream all entries in the underlying store from start to end. Use the options described below to control the range, direction and results.

```js
db.createReadStream()
  .on('data', function (data) {
    console.log(data.key, '=', data.value)
  })
  .on('error', function (err) {
    console.log('Oh my!', err)
  })
  .on('close', function () {
    console.log('Stream closed')
  })
  .on('end', function () {
    console.log('Stream ended')
  })
```

You can supply an options object as the first parameter to `createReadStream()` with the following properties:

* `gt` (greater than), `gte` (greater than or equal) define the lower bound of the range to be streamed. Only entries where the key is greater than (or equal to) this option will be included in the range. When `reverse=true` the order will be reversed, but the entries streamed will be the same.

* `lt` (less than), `lte` (less than or equal) define the higher bound of the range to be streamed. Only entries where the key is less than (or equal to) this option will be included in the range. When `reverse=true` the order will be reversed, but the entries streamed will be the same.

* `reverse` *(boolean, default: `false`)*: stream entries in reverse order. Beware that due to the way that stores like LevelDB work, a reverse seek can be slower than a forward seek.

* `limit` *(number, default: `-1`)*: limit the number of entries collected by this stream. This number represents a *maximum* number of entries and may not be reached if you get to the end of the range first. A value of `-1` means there is no limit. When `reverse=true` the entries with the highest keys will be returned instead of the lowest keys.

* `keys` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: whether the results should contain keys. If set to `true` and `values` set to `false` then results will simply be keys, rather than objects with a `key` property. Used internally by the `createKeyStream()` method.

* `values` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: whether the results should contain values. If set to `true` and `keys` set to `false` then results will simply be values, rather than objects with a `value` property. Used internally by the `createValueStream()` method.

<a name="createKeyStream"></a>
### `db.createKeyStream([options])`

Returns a [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) of keys rather than key-value pairs. Use the same options as described for [`createReadStream`](#createReadStream) to control the range and direction.

You can also obtain this stream by passing an options object to `createReadStream()` with `keys` set to `true` and `values` set to `false`. The result is equivalent; both streams operate in [object mode](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode).

```js
db.createKeyStream()
  .on('data', function (data) {
    console.log('key=', data)
  })

// same as:
db.createReadStream({ keys: true, values: false })
  .on('data', function (data) {
    console.log('key=', data)
  })
```

<a name="createValueStream"></a>
### `db.createValueStream([options])`

Returns a [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) of values rather than key-value pairs. Use the same options as described for [`createReadStream`](#createReadStream) to control the range and direction.

You can also obtain this stream by passing an options object to `createReadStream()` with `values` set to `true` and `keys` set to `false`. The result is equivalent; both streams operate in [object mode](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode).

```js
db.createValueStream()
  .on('data', function (data) {
    console.log('value=', data)
  })

// same as:
db.createReadStream({ keys: false, values: true })
  .on('data', function (data) {
    console.log('value=', data)
  })
```

## Promise Support

`level-rocksdb` ships with native `Promise` support out of the box.

Each function taking a callback also can be used as a promise, if the callback is omitted. This applies for:

- `db.get(key[, options])`
- `db.put(key, value[, options])`
- `db.del(key[, options])`
- `db.batch(ops[, options])`
- `db.batch().write()`

The only exception is the constructor, which if no callback is passed will lazily open the underlying store in the background.

Example:

```js
const db = level('./my-db')

db.put('foo', 'bar')
  .then(function () { return db.get('foo') })
  .then(function (value) { console.log(value) })
  .catch(function (err) { console.error(err) })
```

Or using `async/await`:

```js
const main = async () => {
  const db = level('./my-db')

  await db.put('foo', 'bar')
  console.log(await db.get('foo'))
}
```

## Events

`levelup` is an [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) and emits the following events.

| Event     | Description                 | Arguments            |
|:----------|:----------------------------|:---------------------|
| `put`     | Key has been updated        | `key, value` (any)   |
| `del`     | Key has been deleted        | `key` (any)          |
| `batch`   | Batch has executed          | `operations` (array) |
| `opening` | Underlying store is opening | -                    |
| `open`    | Store has opened            | -                    |
| `ready`   | Alias of `open`             | -                    |
| `closing` | Store is closing            | -                    |
| `closed`  | Store has closed.           | -                    |

For example you can do:

```js
db.on('put', function (key, value) {
  console.log('inserted', { key, value })
})
```
